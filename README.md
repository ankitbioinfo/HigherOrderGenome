Matlab figures plots nice subplots. In these subplots you can plot anything. 
You can use any snippet or whole code for your own use. 

Python codes are used for generating the plotting data from simulation data. 

These are the quantity calculated and plotted by python and matlab respectively. 

(1)  S(R) radial distribution of DNA of a chromosome<br/>  
(2)  S_CM(R) radial distribution of the center-of-mass of a chromosome<br/> 
(3)  Errorbar: errorbar in the center-of-mass of a chromosome from many simulation<br/>
(4)  diffusion:  euclidean distance of two monomers of a polymer chain diffusing in time <br/>
(5)  Contact pb: <br/>
(6)  Contact maps: <br/>
(7)  Distance maps: <br/>
(8)  Spatial distance: <br/>
(9)  centromere distribution: <br/> 
(10) Volume intermingle:  two methods  <br/> 
(11) Distribution of active and inactive monomers:  <br/>
(12) Distribution of individual monomers:  <br/>
